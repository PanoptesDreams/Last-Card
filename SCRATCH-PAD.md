## SCRATCH-PAD

DISREGARD. THIS IS A SCRATCH PAD THAT IS OLD

Block: The 10 aka a Skip-Go is considered a block in some versions (to prevent a Pick-Up pile, per example). To simplify this definition for the 10 it may be defined as 'blocking' a players singular turn.
To acommodate this and advanced play we think we may have a compromise: Instead of nullifying the pick-up stack, we nullifying the last played card.

Nulls: traditional block. not observed at this point.

Bombs:


Null Card: 10 of Diamonds, immediately terminate any effects in play, not observed when used in stacks or general flow (i.e a skip-go)
