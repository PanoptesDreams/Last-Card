## Gameplay

One player is assigned as the dealer, shuffle the cards to satisfaction then continue to general play.

The Dealer distributes seven cards to each player, one per player in a clockwise fashion until each player has their seven cards.

The Dealer turns over the top card of the deck and places it face-up. This card determines the starting suit and rank.

The player left or clockwise to the dealer is first to act.
(It must be noted that if a power card is displayed as the first card, there are no penalties or benefits for the first to act.)

The player must play a card (or cards) that is of the same rank or suit as the top card, if they can not, then they must draw a card from the Draw Pile.
If this card can be played, and the next player has not gone yet, you may play your card, but be quick!
Hand mashes and 'Snap' arguments will result in a penalty from a judge.

The game continues until players exhaust their cards.
If the deck exhausts (TO BE TESTED)
EITHER (The game instantly ends and the ranking is determinde by card count, - OR - deck shuffles and a fresh top card is played face up)

If a player is left with a single card or a 'last card' and does not declare it, they must pick up two cards.
A last card can be declared either: At the beginning of your final turn, or at the end of your penultimate turn.

## Notes

Why are blocks not available in this edition?

Because we have not integrated them yet, we have some ideas on how to integrate.
We want to deal with the fact that a single block can take down a stack of pickups.
Also, if blocks are introduced, we want to have have Jacks, or as we trad know them, reversals, to be integrated with the same finesse.

Ideas: Playing a reversal (J) causes the player and the last to act to share the draw stack
